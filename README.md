# Full Stack Task 

Implement a solution in Node.js using WebSockets (Native or Socket.io)
and HTTP, that creates a basic to-do list, with the following
functionalities -
Add new items to the list by sending a message with add event to the
WS Server
Store the items as a stringified Array in a Redis Cache with a single key
called FULLSTACK_TASK_<YOUR_FIRST_NAME>
If there are more than 50 items in the cache, move them to a MongoDB
Collection and flush them from the Cache.
Retrieve all items in the list through /fetchAllTasks endpoint of a HTTP
API
Make the following frontend in React.js/Vue.js/Svelte.js and integrate
with the backend -

Make reusable components/templates wherever possible
Use of Tailwind CSS will be a plus, but isn't a must
Design must be responsive and fit accordingly on Tablet and Mobile
Screens
